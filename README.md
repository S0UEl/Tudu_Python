Task_1:Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
In this program, I created two variables, Num_1 and Num_2, to store numeric input from the user. I used the int() function to convert the input values into integers. To take input from the user, I used the input() function. After that, I performed four basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I stored each result in a separate variable and displayed the output using the print() function.


#task_2: Create a Personalized Greeting

In this program, the user is first asked to enter their first name and last name separately using the input() function. These two values are stored in the variables First_name and Last_name. After that, both names are combined using string concatenation to form a full name. Finally, the program displays a personalized greeting message that includes the full name. A newline character (\n) is used before the greeting to make the output look neat.
